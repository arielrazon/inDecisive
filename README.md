# inDecisive

inDecisive is a react-based webApp that allows a user to randomly pick an item in their to-do list, based on importance level. 

inDecisive is designed for users are overwhelmed by their to-do list, and can't decide on which task to start working on. inDecisive will randomly select an item and then begin a pomodoro timer, allowing the user to just start working on /something/

This project was inspired by the "How to ADHD" channel's recommendation to organize tasks by urgency/importance.
