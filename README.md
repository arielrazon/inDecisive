# PetSitter
PetSitter is a Full-stack Web-Based Application made for users to be able to search for pet sitters in their area and easily contact them.  Members are also able to view pet sitters' information and add them to their Favorites page.

PetSitter utilizes the MERN (MongoDB/Express/React/NodeJS technologies) stack architecture and follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.
